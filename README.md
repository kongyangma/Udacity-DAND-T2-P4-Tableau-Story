# Creating a Tableau-Story

Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) - Term 2 - Project 3


**Project Overview**


In this project, we will create a data visualization using Tableau that indicates trends or patterns in a dataset.

Before we start the project, we have installed Tableau Desktop. If you have not installed it yet, please do it before you start the project.


**Project Details**


For the final project, I will create an explanatory data visualization from a data set that communicates a clear finding or that highlights relationships or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, and your final deliverable will be a write up along with a Tableau Public workbook.

I will be creating a data story to answer the question, 'Are discounted orders more or less profitable than non-discounted orders?'

I have stated below the steps of doing a data visualization.

**Step One - Choose a Data Set**

First of all, we need to choose a data set. Then, create a visualization that communicates the findings.

**Step Two - Find a Data Story**

Explore your data set and craft a message or story around your data. Think about the overall message you want to convey and think about the informations you want your readers to see. Remember the key point of creating a data visualization is to explain the patterns or identify one or more key insights in the dataset, helping your business to better solve problems. 

**Step Three - Create Your Visualization**

First, mind mapping your visualization, and get sketch ideas for your visualization. Doing a mind mapping would help you better understand the purpose of the your visualization, make the goal clearer.

**Step Four - Get Feedback**

Share your visualization with at least one other person and document their feedback. There are many ways to get feedback, and more feedback is generally better.


**About the Data**


In order to solve the question, 'Are discounted orders more or less profitable than non-discounted orders?', I used the sample store data set, Sample - Superstore.xls.
